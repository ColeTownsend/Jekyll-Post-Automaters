# Blog Post Templates

These are some blog post templates and Ruby scripts to create posts for Jekyll. You can watch a screencast on how to use these, [here](http://ttimsmith.com/videos/automating-jekyll-posts-with-alfred).

The orginal script was made by [Cody Krieger](http://blog.codykrieger.com/2011/02/11/automating-post-creation-with-jekyll.html), and I made some modifications so that it works with [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/).
