# Blog Post Templates

These are some blog post templates and Ruby scripts to create posts for Jekyll. Eventually, I'll make a screencast on how to properly use this, till then, you'll just have to figure it out.

The orginal script was made by [Cody Krieger](#), and I made some modifications so that it works with [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/).
